# Python Chatbot

Filename: Chatbot
This code uses the ChatterBot library to create a new chatbot instance, train it on the English corpus, and start a conversation with the user. The ChatterBotCorpusTrainer class is used to train the chatbot on the "chatterbot.corpus.english" corpus, which includes thousands of example conversations that the chatbot can learn from.

Once the chatbot is trained, the get_response() method can be used to generate a response to the user's input. The try/except block is used to catch any errors that may occur during the conversation, such as if the user types Ctrl+C to exit the program.

Of course, this is just a simple example, and there's a lot more that you can do with ChatterBot and other AI frameworks to create a more sophisticated and intelligent chatbot.

Filename: Chatbot Tensorflow
This code uses the Universal Sentence Encoder, a pre-trained NLU model from TensorFlow Hub, to convert the user's input to a vector representation that can be used to compare it with the chatbot's memory. The memory is stored as a list of vector representations of previous inputs and responses. The generate_response() function calculates the similarity between the user's input and each memory using the cosine similarity, and then generates a response based on the most similar memory. If none of the memories are similar enough, the chatbot responds with a default message.

This is just a basic example, and there are many ways to improve and customize the chatbot's behavior and responses. To make it more sophisticated and intelligent, you may need to incorporate additional deep learning models, such as NLG models to generate more natural-sounding responses, and training algorithms to fine-tune the chatbot's behavior based on user feedback.
