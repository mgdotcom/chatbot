# Python Chatbot

This code uses the ChatterBot library to create a new chatbot instance, train it on the English corpus, and start a conversation with the user. The ChatterBotCorpusTrainer class is used to train the chatbot on the "chatterbot.corpus.english" corpus, which includes thousands of example conversations that the chatbot can learn from.

Once the chatbot is trained, the get_response() method can be used to generate a response to the user's input. The try/except block is used to catch any errors that may occur during the conversation, such as if the user types Ctrl+C to exit the program.

Of course, this is just a simple example, and there's a lot more that you can do with ChatterBot and other AI frameworks to create a more sophisticated and intelligent chatbot.
